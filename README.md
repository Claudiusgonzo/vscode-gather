# Gather for the Python extension

A [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/VSCode) that adds the gather feature to the [Python extension](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-python). Gather adds first-class support for refactoring code out of notebooks and into either a script, or another simplified notebook. It will give you only the necessary code you need to execute to reach your selected output.
